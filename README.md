## Quick Start (Backend Demo)

```bash
cd backend
python3 tests/test_basic.py  # Run tests
python3 main.py demo         # See demo
python3 main.py              # Interactive mode
```

## Game Rules

"Wheel of Fortune" combines word puzzles with chance:

1. **Teams take turns** spinning a wheel and guessing letters
2. **Money segments** award cash for correct consonant guesses
3. **Special segments** create gameplay variety (BANKRUPT, FREE SPIN, etc.)
4. **Vowels cost $250** but don't earn money
5. **Solve the puzzle** to win the round and keep your money
6. **Highest total** after all rounds wins the game

## Frontend Development Plan

The backend provides a clean API ready for any frontend technology:

### Recommended Tech Stack Options
1. **Web App**: React/Vue.js + Python Flask/FastAPI
2. **Desktop**: Electron or Python Tkinter/PyQt
3. **Mobile**: React Native or Flutter with API backend

### Key Integration Points
- **GameEngine**: Single interface for all game operations
- **WheelResult Enum**: Easy dropdown/button wheel selection
- **Rich State Objects**: Complete game status for UI updates
- **Event Responses**: Detailed action results for user feedback

### UI Components Needed
- **Team Setup**: Create teams and add members
- **Game Board**: Display puzzle, category, and guessed letters
- **Wheel Interface**: Select wheel result from enum options
- **Action Buttons**: Guess letter, buy vowel, solve puzzle
- **Scoreboard**: Show team money and leaderboard
- **Game Controls**: Round progression and game management

## Design Philosophy

- **Physical Integration**: Complement real-world wheel spinning
- **Team-Oriented**: Built for group play and social interaction
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adaptable to different group sizes
- **Simple Deployment**: Minimal dependencies for easy setup
- **Extensible**: Easy to add puzzles, modify rules, or enhance features

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Frontend Technology** based on your preferences
2. **Create UI Mockups** for the game interface
3. **Set up API Layer** (Flask/FastAPI) if building web app
4. **Implement Core Components** using the backend GameEngine
5. **Add Polish**: Animations, sounds, and enhanced user experience

The backend foundation is solid and ready for any frontend approach!

## Development Notes

- **Python 3.8+** required for backend
- **No external dependencies** for core game logic
- **JSON-based puzzle storage** for easy customization
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Full test coverage** of core functionality
- **Type hints throughout** for better code quality

Ready to build an amazing Wheel of Fortune experience! ðŸŽ¡
